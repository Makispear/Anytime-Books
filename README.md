# Anytime Books

## Description
This project provides a simple application to help a user choose their next book to read, without having to comb scores of sites for basic information.  Users can utilize a simple interface and be provided a small selection of books that peak their interests, based on their choices, without being overwhelmed.  By selecting a topic, from a drop-down list, a user can request information about books that are currently on a Best Seller list.  They can then review the Title of the book, the Author, and view the cover and a brief description. 

Then the user, choose store selections of their choice, for retrieval at a later time.  Hence, 'Anytime Books!'. 'Best Seller' book selections change, sometimes, on a weekly basis and memories fail us, especially during these busy times.  Never forget the book you wanted to read, again!  No more chasing down lost notes on little pieces of paper.  The books will be listed, on the save page, with just a 'çlick'.

At this time, users can look at the save list, where they will be able to again view the book's cover, Title, Author, and the ISBN. If they did not choose to install the site/application on their local machine, they can also see what others are interested in reading.

## Roadmap
Initial release: The current application includes the ability to make a selection from a Best Seller list and save information, in local storage, on your machine, for future use (retrievals, and additions).  It does not cross-sync between devices, at this time.

Future features:  
  * Provide users a way to delete an unwanted book.
  * Provide users a way to mark a book as read.
  * Provide users to links to sites for purchasing books or reading reviews.
  * Provide feedback to other users with a like or dislike entry and count.
  * Provide users a pull-out frame, instead of separate page for save their reading list.
