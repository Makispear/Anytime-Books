# Project-2 (to be updated)

## Description
In this project, we wanted to provide a simple application to help a user choose their next book to read, without having to comb scores of sites for basic information.  Users need a simple interface to be provided a small selection, of interest, without being overwhelmed.  The user can request information about books that are currently on the Best Seller list.  The user will be able to store their selections, in local storage, for retrieval.  Considering that the 'Best Seller' book selections may change on a weekly basis; this will allow the user to keep track of his choices, for future reference.
